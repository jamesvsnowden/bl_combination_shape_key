# Combination Shape Keys

### Combination Shape Keys for Blender

A combination shape key is a shape key that is driven by one or more other shape keys. They enable you to have more precise control over the way in which shape keys deform the model and are particularly useful in facial animation.

Considered by many animators to be an indispensable part of character development, combination shape keys have been available in other software packages for years, but sorely lacking from Blender.

This addon brings a powerful implementation of combination shape keys to Blender that remains intuitive and simple to use and integrates seamlessly into the software.

Combination Shape Keys has been carefully crafted so that it builds the required components using Blender's native toolset, meaning you can share or sell your creations with other users without requiring them to install the addon, and integrate the addon into your pipeline without worrying about compatibility issues.
