**Shape Keys** are set to **Relative**, and you have created at least one shape key.</alert>

### Selecting Drivers

Selecting **New Combination Shape Key** from the **Shape Key Specials** menu will show a popup
with a list of available shape keys. Select each shape key that you want to use as a *driver*
for the new combination shape key using the checkboxes.

Once you're happy with your selection you can give the new combination shape key a name and click
**OK** to create it.

The new combination shape key will be created and the selected shape keys will be added as drivers.
You will find the settings for the combination shape key in the **Combination Shape Key Drivers**
panel that will be shown below the other settings in the **Shape Keys** panel.

## Using An Existing Shape Key

If you have already created a shape key that you want to use as a combination shape key, you can
select the **Select Combination Shape Key Drivers** option from the **Shape Key Specials** menu.
Much like the process for creating new combination shape keys, a popup panel will allow you to
select which shape keys you want to use as *drivers*.
